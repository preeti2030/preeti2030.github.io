<h2>Blue Beach (La Chiva), Vieques, Puerto Rico</h2>
<p>A long, thin stretch of white sand and clear water makes this one of the Caribbean's top beaches. Getting there is part of the adventure: It can only be accessed by parking in one of 21 tiny turn-offs along a bumpy, unpaved road in the middle of the island's western National Wildlife Refuge (formerly off-limits as a U.S. Navy training base). Snorkel on your own around a small cay, or book a trip with one of the island's operators to check out its secret underwater spots.

Where to stay: The W on Vieques was nearly completely destroyed by Hurricane Maria in 2017. However, other properties on the island survived, and one of our all-time favorites—and Hot List 2014 winner—is El Blok. In a nod to 1950’s tropical modernism, the 22-room inn has a curvaceous exterior with intricately carved louvers that prompt the bright Caribbean sun to cast dramatic shadows. Interiors have a restful vibe, thanks to clean-lined wooden furnishings and strategically placed sculptures.</p>
